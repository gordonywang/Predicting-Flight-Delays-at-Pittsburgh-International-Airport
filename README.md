# Predicting-Flight-Delays-at-Pittsburgh-International-Airport
Final Project | 36-462: Data Mining

•	Forecasted as team of 3 flight departure delays in 2017 at Pittsburgh International Airport with classification predictive modeling, utilizing combination of Bureau of Transportation Statistics commercial flight data and NOAA weather data. 

•	Built and validated one of two machine learning algorithms required for project by fitting and training gradient boosting decision tree ensemble models in R with XGBoost. 

• Achieved augmented performance of 0.7027 on test set as measured by Area Under Curve (AUC) of Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) through carefully tuning sensitive parameters and running 10-fold stratified cross-validation.

The code for XGBoost implementation can be found above in the xgboost_tuning.rmd file.

The R environment file needed to run the XGBoost code is avaiable above as temp_env.Rdata

The final report for this project can be accessed via the .doc file above.
