# Predicting-Flight-Delays-at-Pittsburgh-International-Airport
Final Project | 36-462: Data Mining

•	Forecasted as team of 3 flight departure delays in 2017 at Pittsburgh International Airport with classification predictive modeling, using combination of Bureau of Transportation Statistics commercial flight data and NOAA weather data. 

•	Built and validated one of two machine learning algorithms required for project by designing XGBoost models in R to execute gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) type ensemble learning. Achieved augmented performance of 0.7027 on test set as measured by Area Under Curve (AUC) of Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve through carefully tuning sensitive parameters and running 10-fold stratified cross-validation.
